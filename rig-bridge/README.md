# 📻 OpenHamClock Rig Bridge

**Let OpenHamClock talk to your radio — click a spot, your radio tunes.**

Rig Bridge is a small program that runs on your computer and acts as a translator between OpenHamClock and your radio. Once it is running, you can click any DX spot, POTA activation, or SOTA summit in OpenHamClock and your radio will automatically tune to the right frequency and mode.

It also connects FT8/FT4 decoding software (WSJT-X, JTDX, MSHV, JS8Call) to OpenHamClock, so all your decoded stations appear live on the map.

## Supported Radios

### Direct USB connection (recommended for most hams)

You connect the radio to your computer with a USB cable — no extra software needed.

| Brand        | Tested Models                                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Yaesu**    | FT-991A, FT-891, FT-710, FT-DX10, FT-DX101, FT-5000 |
| **Kenwood**  | TS-890, TS-590, TS-2000, TS-480                     |
| **Icom**     | IC-7300, IC-7610, IC-9700, IC-705, IC-7851          |
| **Elecraft** | K3, K4, KX3, KX2 (use the Kenwood plugin)           |

### SDR software radios (Hermes Lite 2, ANAN, SunSDR)

These connect over your local network rather than USB.

| Software      | Compatible Radios          |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Thetis**    | Hermes Lite 2, ANAN series |
| **ExpertSDR** | SunSDR2                    |

### FlexRadio SmartSDR (6000 / 8000 series)

Connects directly over your home network — no extra software needed on the FlexRadio side.

### RTL-SDR dongle (receive only)

Cheap USB TV tuner dongles used as software-defined receivers. Frequency tuning works; transmit/PTT does not apply.

### Already using flrig or rigctld?

If you already have **flrig** or **rigctld** (Hamlib) running and controlling your radio, Rig Bridge can connect to those instead of talking to the radio directly. This lets you keep your existing setup.

### No radio? Test with the simulator

Select **Simulated Radio** in the setup screen. A fake radio will drift through the bands so you can try everything without any hardware connected.

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1 — Download and run Rig Bridge

**Option A — Standalone executable (easiest, no installation needed)**

1. Go to the Releases page and download the file for your operating system:
   - `ohc-rig-bridge-win.exe` — Windows
   - `ohc-rig-bridge-macos` — macOS (Intel)
   - `ohc-rig-bridge-macos-arm` — macOS (Apple Silicon / M1, M2, M3, M4)
   - `ohc-rig-bridge-linux` — Linux
2. Double-click the file to run it. On macOS you may need to right-click → Open the first time.
3. A terminal/console window will appear showing log messages — leave it running.

**Option B — Run from source with Node.js**

If you have Node.js installed:

```bash
cd rig-bridge
npm install
node rig-bridge.js
```

### Step 2 — Open the setup page

Once Rig Bridge is running, open your web browser and go to:

**http://localhost:5555**

> **What is localhost:5555?** `localhost` means "this computer" — Rig Bridge is running on your own machine, not on the internet. `5555` is just the "door number" (port) it listens on. Nothing is sent to the internet.

You will see the Rig Bridge setup screen. The first time it opens, your **API Token** (a security password) will be shown automatically — Rig Bridge logs you in for you.

> **What is the API Token?** It is a password that protects Rig Bridge from being controlled by other websites you might visit. Keep it private. You will need to paste it into OpenHamClock once.

### Step 3 — Configure your radio

See [Connecting Your Radio](#connecting-your-radio) below for step-by-step instructions for your specific radio.

### Step 4 — Connect to OpenHamClock

See [Connecting to OpenHamClock](#connecting-to-openhamclock) below.

### SDR radios via Thetis or ExpertSDR (Hermes Lite 2, ANAN, SunSDR)

These connect over your local network using the TCI protocol — no USB cable needed.

**Step 1 — Enable TCI in your SDR software**

- **Thetis:** Setup → CAT Control → tick **Enable TCI Server** (default port: 40001)
- **ExpertSDR:** Settings → TCI → Enable (default port: 40001)

**Step 2 — In Rig Bridge setup:**

1. Radio Type → **TCI / SDR**
2. Host → `localhost` (or the IP address of the machine running the SDR software if it is on a different computer)
3. Port → **40001**
4. Click **Save & Connect**

You should see in the Rig Bridge log:

```
[TCI] ✅ Connected to ws://localhost:40001
[TCI] Device: Thetis
```

Rig Bridge will automatically reconnect if the SDR software is restarted.

---

### FlexRadio SmartSDR (6000 / 8000 series)

**In Rig Bridge setup:**

1. Radio Type → **SmartSDR**
2. Host → the IP address of your FlexRadio on your network (e.g. `192.168.1.100`)

4. Slice Index → **0** (Slice A; change to 1 for Slice B, etc.)
5. Click **Save & Connect**

You should see:

```
[SmartSDR] ✅ Connected — Slice A on 14.074 MHz
```

---

### Connecting via flrig or rigctld (existing setups)

If you already have flrig or rigctld (Hamlib) controlling your radio, Rig Bridge can connect to them. This way you do not need to change anything in your existing workflow.

**flrig:**

1. Radio Type → **flrig**
2. Host → `127.0.0.1` (or the IP where flrig runs)
3. Port → **12345**

**rigctld:**

1. Radio Type → **rigctld**
2. Host → `127.0.0.1`
3. Port → **4532**

---

## Connecting to OpenHamClock

### Scenario A — Everything on the same computer (most common)

OpenHamClock and Rig Bridge both run on your shack computer.

1. Make sure Rig Bridge is running and your radio is connected (green dot in the status bar)
2. Open OpenHamClock in your browser
3. Go to **Settings → Rig Bridge**
4. Tick **Enable Rig Bridge**
5. Host: `http://localhost` — Port: `5555`
6. Copy the **API Token** from the Rig Bridge setup page and paste it into the token field
7. Tick **Click-to-tune** if you want spot clicks to tune your radio
8. Click **Save**

That is it. Click any DX spot, POTA or SOTA activation on the map and your radio tunes automatically.

---

### Scenario B — Radio on one computer, OpenHamClock on another

For example: Rig Bridge runs on a Raspberry Pi or shack PC connected to the radio. OpenHamClock runs on a laptop elsewhere in the house.

**On the shack computer (where the radio is):**

1. Start Rig Bridge with network access enabled:
   - If running from source: `node rig-bridge.js --bind 0.0.0.0`
   - Or set `"bindAddress": "0.0.0.0"` in the config file
2. Find the shack computer's IP address (e.g. `192.168.1.50`)
3. Configure your radio at `http://192.168.1.50:5555`

**On the other computer (where OpenHamClock runs):**

1. Settings → Rig Bridge → Host: `http://192.168.1.50` — Port: `5555`
2. Paste the API Token from the shack computer's setup page
3. Save

> **Security note:** When you open Rig Bridge to the network (`0.0.0.0`), it is accessible to any device on your home network. The API Token protects it from unauthorised commands. Do not do this on a public or shared network.

---

### Scenario C — Using the cloud version at openhamclock.com

This lets you control your radio at home from anywhere in the world through the openhamclock.com website.

**Step 1 — Install Rig Bridge on your home computer**

Download and run Rig Bridge on the computer that is connected to your radio (see [Getting Started](#getting-started)).

**Step 2 — Configure your radio**

Open http://localhost:5555 and set up your radio. Make sure the green "connected" dot appears.

**Step 3 — Enable HTTPS on Rig Bridge**

The openhamclock.com website uses a secure connection (HTTPS), and browsers will not allow it to talk to a non-secure Rig Bridge. You need to enable HTTPS first — see the [HTTPS Setup](#https-setup) section for the full walkthrough.

**Step 4 — Connect from OpenHamClock**

1. Go to https://openhamclock.com → **Settings → Rig Bridge**
2. Host: `https://localhost` — Port: `5555`
3. Paste your API Token
4. Click **Connect Cloud Relay**

How it works behind the scenes:

```
Your shack                              openhamclock.com
────────────                            ────────────────
Radio (USB) ←→ Rig Bridge ──HTTPS──→  Your browser
  └─ WSJT-X                              └─ Click-to-tune
  └─ Direwolf/APRS TNC                   └─ PTT
  └─ Antenna rotator                     └─ FT8 decodes on map
```

---

## Digital Mode Software

Rig Bridge can receive decoded FT8, FT4, JT65, and other digital mode signals from your decoding software and display them live in OpenHamClock — all stations appear on the map in real time.

### Supported software

| Software    | Mode                          | Default Port |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ------------ |
| **WSJT-X**  | FT8, FT4, JT65, JT9, and more | 2237         |
| **JTDX**    | FT8, JT65 (enhanced decoding) | 2238         |
| **MSHV**    | MSK144, Q65, and others       | 2239         |
| **JS8Call** | JS8 keyboard messaging        | 2242         |

All of these are **bidirectional** — OpenHamClock can also send replies, stop transmit, set free text, and highlight callsigns in the decode window.

### Setting up WSJT-X (same steps apply to JTDX and MSHV)

**Step 1 — In WSJT-X:**

1. Open **File → Settings → Reporting**
2. Set **UDP Server** to `127.0.0.1`
3. Set **UDP Server port** to `2237`
4. Make sure **Accept UDP requests** is ticked

**Step 2 — In Rig Bridge:**

1. Open http://localhost:5555 → **Plugins** tab
2. Find **WSJT-X Relay** and tick **Enable**
3. Click **Save**

Decoded stations will now appear on the OpenHamClock map. When you first open the map, the last 100 decoded stations are shown immediately — you do not have to wait for the next FT8 cycle.

> **⚠️ Important — start Rig Bridge before WSJT-X**
>
> Both programs listen on the same UDP port. Whichever starts first gets the port. Always start Rig Bridge first, then start WSJT-X (or JTDX / MSHV). If you see `UDP port already in use` in the Rig Bridge log, stop WSJT-X, restart Rig Bridge, then start WSJT-X again.

### Multicast — sharing decodes with multiple programs

By default, WSJT-X sends its decoded packets only to one listener. If you want both Rig Bridge and another program (e.g. GridTracker) to receive decodes at the same time, use multicast:

1. In WSJT-X: **File → Settings → Reporting → UDP Server** — set the address to `224.0.0.1`
2. In Rig Bridge → Plugins → WSJT-X Relay → tick **Enable Multicast**, group address `224.0.0.1`
3. Click **Save**

---

## APRS via Local TNC

If you run a local APRS TNC (for example, [Direwolf](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf) connected to a VHF radio), Rig Bridge can receive APRS packets from it and show nearby stations on the OpenHamClock map — without needing an internet connection.

This works alongside the regular internet-based APRS-IS feed. When the internet goes down, local RF keeps the map populated.

### Setup with Direwolf

1. Start Direwolf with KISS TCP enabled (it listens on port 8001 by default)
2. In Rig Bridge → Plugins tab → find **APRS TNC** → tick **Enable**
3. Protocol → **KISS TCP**
4. Host → `127.0.0.1`, Port → `8001`
5. Enter your callsign (required if you want to transmit beacons)
6. Click **Save**

APRS packets from nearby stations on RF will now appear alongside internet-sourced APRS stations on the map.

### Hardware TNC (serial port)

If you have a traditional hardware TNC connected via serial port:

1. Protocol → **KISS Serial**
2. Serial Port → select your TNC's COM port
3. Baud Rate → **9600** (check your TNC's documentation)

---

## Antenna Rotator

Rig Bridge can control antenna rotators via [Hamlib's](https://hamlib.github.io/) `rotctld` daemon.

1. Start rotctld for your rotator model, for example:
   ```
   rotctld -m 202 -r /dev/ttyUSB1 -t 4533
   ```
2. In Rig Bridge → Plugins tab → find **Rotator** → tick **Enable**
3. Host → `127.0.0.1`, Port → `4533`
4. Click **Save**

---

## HTTPS Setup

### Do I need this?

**Yes**, if you use openhamclock.com or any other HTTPS-hosted version of OpenHamClock.

**No**, if you run OpenHamClock locally on your own computer (e.g. http://localhost:3000) — you can skip this section.

### Why is HTTPS needed?

Web browsers have a security rule called "mixed content": a page loaded over a secure connection (`https://`) is not allowed to communicate with a non-secure address (`http://`). Because openhamclock.com uses HTTPS, it cannot talk to Rig Bridge unless Rig Bridge also uses HTTPS.

Rig Bridge solves this by generating its own security certificate — a small file that proves the connection is encrypted. Because the certificate is created by Rig Bridge itself (not by a certificate authority), your browser will not automatically trust it. You need to install it once, which tells your browser "I trust this certificate on this computer".

### Complete step-by-step setup

#### Step 1 — Enable HTTPS in Rig Bridge

1. Open **http://localhost:5555** in your browser
2. Click the **🔒 Security** tab
3. Tick **Enable HTTPS**
4. Rig Bridge will generate a certificate automatically (takes a few seconds)
5. **Quit and restart Rig Bridge**
6. From now on, open **https://localhost:5555** (note the `s` in `https`)

#### Step 2 — Deal with the browser warning

The first time you open https://localhost:5555 after enabling HTTPS, your browser will show a security warning. This is expected — the certificate is genuine, but your browser does not yet trust it.

**Chrome / Edge:**

1. On the warning page, click **Advanced**
2. Click **Proceed to localhost (unsafe)**

**Firefox:**

1. On the warning page, click **Advanced**
2. Click **Accept the Risk and Continue**

**Safari:**

1. Click **Show Details**
2. Click **visit this website**
3. Enter your macOS password if asked

You only need to do this once.

#### Step 3 — Install the certificate so you never see the warning again

Installing the certificate permanently tells your computer to trust Rig Bridge's HTTPS connection. After this, the browser will show a normal padlock icon with no warnings.

**Easiest way — use the Install button:**

1. Make sure you are on **https://localhost:5555** (accepted the warning in Step 2)
2. Go to the **🔒 Security** tab
3. Click **⬇ Download Certificate** — save the file `rig-bridge.crt`
4. Click **Install Certificate** — Rig Bridge will try to install it automatically

If the Install button succeeds, you are done. If it asks for a password or fails, follow the manual steps for your operating system below.

---

**macOS — manual install:**

1. Download the certificate from the Security tab
2. Double-click `rig-bridge.crt`
3. Keychain Access opens — the certificate appears under **login** keychain
4. Double-click the certificate in Keychain Access
5. Expand **Trust** → set **When using this certificate** to **Always Trust**
6. Close the window and enter your macOS password when asked
7. Restart your browser

Or in Terminal:

```bash
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot \
  -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain \
  ~/.config/openhamclock/certs/rig-bridge.crt
```

---

**Windows — manual install:**

1. Download the certificate from the Security tab
2. Double-click `rig-bridge.crt`
3. Click **Install Certificate**
4. Select **Local Machine** → click Next
5. Select **Place all certificates in the following store** → click Browse
6. Select **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** → OK
7. Click Next → Finish
8. Restart your browser

Or in Command Prompt (run as Administrator):

```cmd
certutil -addstore -f ROOT %APPDATA%\openhamclock\certs\rig-bridge.crt
```

---

**Linux — manual install:**

1. Download the certificate from the Security tab
2. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
sudo cp ~/Downloads/rig-bridge.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
sudo update-ca-certificates
```

3. Import the certificate into your browser:
   - **Chrome / Chromium:** Settings → Privacy & Security → Manage Certificates → Authorities → Import
   - **Firefox:** Settings → Privacy & Security → View Certificates → Authorities → Import → tick "Trust this CA to identify websites"

---

#### Step 4 — Update OpenHamClock settings

Now that Rig Bridge is running on HTTPS, update the address in OpenHamClock:

1. Open OpenHamClock → **Settings → Rig Bridge**
2. Change Host from `http://localhost` to **`https://localhost`**
3. Port stays **5555**
4. Click **Save**

#### Step 5 — Verify everything works

- The padlock icon appears in your browser's address bar when visiting https://localhost:5555 ✓
- The status bar in OpenHamClock shows Rig Bridge as connected ✓
- Clicking a spot tunes your radio ✓

### Reverting to plain HTTP

If you ever want to go back to plain HTTP (for example, if you stop using openhamclock.com):

1. Open https://localhost:5555 → **🔒 Security** tab
2. Untick **Enable HTTPS**
3. Restart Rig Bridge
4. Open **http://localhost:5555** again and update OpenHamClock settings to `http://localhost`

### Certificate storage location

The certificate file is stored here on your computer:

| Operating System  | Certificate file                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **macOS / Linux** | `~/.config/openhamclock/certs/rig-bridge.crt` |
| **Windows**       | `%APPDATA%\openhamclock\certs\rig-bridge.crt` |

The certificate is valid for 10 years and is regenerated only if you click **Regenerate** in the Security tab. It does not expire with Rig Bridge updates.

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No COM ports shown**                                       | Install the USB driver for your radio. Yaesu/Icom typically use the Silicon Labs CP210x driver. Kenwood and some others use FTDI. |
| **Port opens but radio does not respond**                    | Check the baud rate matches what is set in your radio's menus.                                                                    |
| **Icom not responding**                                      | Double-check the CI-V address matches your exact radio model.                                                                     |
| **PTT not working**                                          | Try enabling **Hardware Flow (RTS/CTS)** in the radio settings (especially for FT-991A, FT-710).                                  |
| **Port already in use**                                      | If you have flrig or rigctld running, close them first — Rig Bridge talks to the radio directly and they would conflict.          |
| **macOS: "Comms Failure"**                                   | Rig Bridge applies a serial port fix automatically on macOS. If problems persist, try unplugging and replugging the USB cable.    |
| **WSJT-X decodes not appearing**                             | Make sure WSJT-X UDP Server is set to `127.0.0.1:2237` in File → Settings → Reporting. Start Rig Bridge before WSJT-X.            |
| **TCI: Connection refused**                                  | Enable TCI Server in your SDR software (Thetis: Setup → CAT Control → Enable TCI Server).                                         |
| **SmartSDR: no connection**                                  | Confirm the FlexRadio is on and reachable on your network. Default API port is 4992.                                              |
| **RTL-SDR: connection refused**                              | Start `rtl_tcp` before Rig Bridge: `rtl_tcp -a 127.0.0.1 -p 1234`. Check no other program (e.g. SDR#) has the dongle open.        |

## Advanced Topics

The sections below are for technically minded users or developers who want to go deeper.

### Where is the config file stored?

Rig Bridge saves its settings to a file in your user folder. This file survives updates — installing a new version of Rig Bridge will never overwrite your settings.

| Operating System  | Config file location                            |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **macOS / Linux** | `~/.config/openhamclock/rig-bridge-config.json` |
| **Windows**       | `%APPDATA%\openhamclock\rig-bridge-config.json` |

### Command-line options

```bash
node rig-bridge.js --port 8080     # Use a different port (default: 5555)
node rig-bridge.js --bind 0.0.0.0  # Allow access from other computers on your network
node rig-bridge.js --debug         # Show raw CAT command traffic in the log
node rig-bridge.js --version       # Print the version number
```

### Building standalone executables

To create the self-contained executables (no Node.js installation required on the target machine):

```bash
npm install
npm run build:win        # Windows (.exe)
npm run build:mac        # macOS Intel
npm run build:mac-arm    # macOS Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)
npm run build:linux      # Linux x64
npm run build:linux-arm  # Linux ARM (Raspberry Pi)
npm run build:all        # All of the above
```

Executables are saved to the `dist/` folder.

### API reference

Rig Bridge exposes a simple HTTP API — compatible with the original rig-daemon format:

| Method | Endpoint      | Description                                               |
| ------ | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/status`     | Current frequency, mode, PTT state, and connection status |
| GET    | `/stream`     | Real-time updates via SSE (Server-Sent Events)            |
| POST   | `/freq`       | Tune radio: `{ "freq": 14074000 }` (frequency in Hz)      |
| POST   | `/mode`       | Set mode: `{ "mode": "USB" }`                             |
| POST   | `/ptt`        | Key transmitter: `{ "ptt": true }`                        |
| GET    | `/api/ports`  | List available serial ports                               |
| GET    | `/api/config` | Read current configuration                                |
| POST   | `/api/config` | Save configuration and reconnect                          |
| POST   | `/api/test`   | Test a serial port without connecting                     |
| GET    | `/api/status` | Lightweight health check                                  |

### Writing a plugin

Each plugin is a JavaScript module that exports a descriptor object:

```js
module.exports = {
  id: 'my-plugin', // unique ID — matches config.radio.type for rig plugins
  name: 'My Plugin',
  category: 'rig', // 'rig' | 'integration' | 'rotator' | 'logger' | 'other'
  configKey: 'radio', // which config section this plugin reads

  create(config, services) {
    const { updateState, state, pluginBus, messageLog } = services;

    return {
      connect() {
        /* open connection to radio */
      },
      disconnect() {
        /* close connection */
      },
      setFreq(hz) {
        /* tune to frequency in Hz */
      },
      setMode(mode) {
        /* set mode string, e.g. 'USB' */
      },
      setPTT(on) {
        /* key or unkey the transmitter */
      },

      // Optional: register extra HTTP routes
      // registerRoutes(app) { app.get('/my-plugin/data', handler) }
    };
  },
};
```

To activate a plugin, call `registry.register(descriptor)` in `rig-bridge.js` before `registry.connectActive()`.

**Plugin categories:**

- `rig` — radio control; `/freq`, `/mode`, `/ptt` are dispatched to the active rig plugin
- `integration` — background service (e.g. WSJT-X relay); started via `registry.connectIntegrations()`
- `rotator`, `logger`, `other` — use `registerRoutes()` to add their own API endpoints
