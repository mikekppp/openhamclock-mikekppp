## Project History

### Origins (v1.x — Jan 2026)

OpenHamClock was built from scratch as a modern, web-based amateur radio dashboard. Inspired by the concept of WB0OEW's HamClock — displaying solar conditions, DX cluster spots, and propagation data — but written entirely from the ground up as a web application. No code was forked or inherited. The goal was a browser-based ham radio dashboard that anyone could run locally or access from anywhere.

### Monolithic Era (v2.x — Jan 2026)

The first web version was a single monolithic HTML file with embedded JavaScript. It worked, but adding features meant editing a massive file with tangled dependencies. This era established the core feature set: world map, DX cluster, solar data, and basic propagation display.

### React Rewrite (v3.0 — v3.12 — Jan–Feb 2026)

A complete rewrite into modular React with Vite and an Express backend. This was the inflection point — the architecture went from a single HTML file to 13 components, 12 hooks, and 3 utility modules. Key milestones:

- **v3.7** — Modular React architecture, Railway and Docker deployment
- **v3.8** — ITURHFProp hybrid propagation predictions, ionosonde corrections
- **v3.9** — Satellite tracking (40+ satellites), DX filtering, map legend
- **v3.10** — Environment-based config (.env), Classic layout, Retro theme
- **v3.11** — PSKReporter integration, 85% bandwidth reduction
- **v3.12** — State persistence, lunar phase, WSPR heatmap, lightning detection

### Scaling & Stability (v15.0 — v15.2 — Feb 2026)

The project hit 2,000+ concurrent users on openhamclock.com, exposing every possible scaling issue:

- **Memory leaks** — Unbounded caches (PSK-MQTT proxy, callsign lookups, propagation heatmap) caused OOM crashes at 4GB after 24 hours. Fixed with entry caps, eviction policies, and memory monitoring.
- **MQTT fork bombs** — Reconnect logic created exponential chains of parallel reconnect loops during broker outages.
- **Request stampedes** — 50 users refreshing simultaneously meant 50 upstream API calls. Built UpstreamManager with request deduplication, stale-while-revalidate, and exponential backoff.
- **PSK-MQTT proxy** — Replaced per-browser MQTT connections with a single server-side connection, cutting SSE traffic in half.
- **Weather 429 cascades** — Moved weather to client-direct Open-Meteo, distributing rate limits across user IPs instead of concentrating on the server.

Also shipped: VOACAP heatmap, rig control, SOTA panel, N0NBH band conditions, user profiles, and server-side settings sync.

### Feature Expansion (v15.4 — v15.5 — Feb 2026)

With stability solved, focus shifted to features and polish:

- **Direct rig control** — Click any spot to tune your radio (Yaesu, Kenwood, Elecraft, Icom via USB serial)
- **Satellite tracker overhaul** — Floating data window, visibility indicators, pinned tracking
- **APRS-IS live tracking** — Full APRS integration with watchlist groups for EmComm
- **Wildfire & storm map layers** — NASA EONET satellite detection
- **13 languages at 100% coverage** — en, de, es, fr, it, ja, ko, ms, nl, pt, sl, ru, ka
- **Ultrawide monitor support** — Sidebars scale proportionally with viewport

### Security Hardening (v15.6 — Mar 2026)

Comprehensive security audit and hardening pass:

- CORS lockdown with explicit origin allowlist
- SSRF elimination for custom DX cluster hosts
- API write key authentication for rotator and QRZ endpoints
- SSE connection limiter, telnet command injection prevention
- DOM XSS fixes, ReDoS fixes, URL encoding
- Dockerfile runs as non-root user

### New Versioning & EmComm (v26.1.1 — Mar 2026)

Adopted year-based versioning: X = year, Y = visual/UI, Z = backend. The jump from v15 to v26 resets the scheme to something meaningful.

- **EmComm layout** — Dedicated emergency communications dashboard with range rings, NWS alerts, FEMA declarations, shelters, and filtered APRS stations
- **APRS resource tokens** — Structured emergency data in beacon comments with visual resource cards
- **Classic layout redesign** — Refreshed while keeping the WB0OEW spirit
- **Active users map layer** — See other operators in real time
- **Audio alerts** — Configurable tones per feed (POTA, SOTA, DX Cluster, etc.)
- **SDR integration** — FlexRadio SmartSDR and RTL-SDR support via rig-bridge
- **DX favorites** — Save up to 10 DX target grid squares for quick switching

## Current State (v26.1.1)

### What's Working Well

- **30+ dashboard modules** — DX Cluster, PSK Reporter, WSJT-X, POTA, SOTA, WWFF, WWBOTA, satellites, APRS, contests, DXpeditions, propagation, solar indices, weather, and more
- **6 layouts** — Modern, Classic, Tablet, Compact, Dockable, EmComm
- **5 themes** — Dark, Light, Legacy, Retro, Custom
- **Rig control** — Click-to-tune across all spot panels
- **Multi-platform** — Browser, Electron desktop, Raspberry Pi kiosk, Docker, Railway
- **16 languages** — ca, de, en, es, fr, it, ja, ka, ko, ms, nl, pt, ru, sl, th, zh
- **Real-time data** — PSK Reporter via server-side MQTT proxy, WSJT-X via UDP, APRS-IS, DX cluster telnet
